##Recent Updates

###[10-24-2019] You've got mail
I got email running on this server again. ryan@rdoyle.net

###[08-02-2019] Metrics and Redesign
Did a quick refresh on the colors and style on this site.<br>
In bigger news, I got a metrics page built and running! Code is on [gitlab](http://gitlab.com/rdoyle/bash-metrics)
and it can be accessed on the 'Public' section on the left. Time selection is a bit hacky for now but will be
more robust in the future.

###[07-08-2019] More storage
Finally got those 2TB disks I've been wanting.<br>
Set up a Tiered backup system using btrfs snapshots. Everything goes to a second 2tb disk and
important stuff goes to a further 500g volume.  The really important stuff winds up backed up to an
offsite location too.

###[01-16-2019] Storage host update
Moved store over to some less-old hardware.<br>
The old hardware was a collection of 250G 2.5 disks that were of questionable status.
smart on those disks showed a lot of problems so I moved to a pair of 500g disks.  It's not quite
the volume that I need to keep everything, but it will hold me over until I can get a couple 2T disks.

###[10-26-2018] GitLab migration
So I abandoned github :|<br>
Nothing personal, I just wanted a platform with free private repos for the most part.
